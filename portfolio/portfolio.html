	<x><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/53802084/"><img src="images/Scratch.JPG" height=250"></a></x>
	<p>This is one of the first Scratch Projects that I made during 8th grade in my Technology Class. This introduced me to programming, and led me to learn more programming
	launguages, such as Python, Java, & now, I am learning RobotC for STEM Robotics Club. You can click the picture to lead you to the website, and you are free to play
	the game.</p>

	<x><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/118994949/"><img src="images/Scratch3.JPG" height=250"></a></x>
	<p>Something I remixed for my first Scratch Program in AP CSP.</p>
	<font size="4"><p>AP CSP Scratch Project - The Piano (Music)</p></font>
	<x><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/119885643/"><img src="images/Scratch4.JPG" height=250"></a></x>
	<p>This was a project that I made with my partner Tristian Domingo. This is a piano which plays the notes which you click with your mouse, or with your keyboard.
	You can change the octave, turn a metronome on, and adjust its tempo, and you can change the instrument each note plays.</p>

	<p>I made this project with Pauline Anzaldo. This project was done in the launguage Python, and in the editor Canopy. This project is a game in which you have to survive for as long as you can. There are many Blue Boulders that are falling, and you, controlling the ship, have to avoid these boulders. The game gets progressively harder.</p>
