<p><font size="5">Thank You Teachers!</font></p>
	<p>
	<p>I have many teachers to thank, that have helped me become who I am today. The first and foremost teacher was Mr. Rossen. He was my 4th Grade Teacher at Rhodes Elementary.
	He showed me that I could be whatever I wanted, and instilled a code of honor & respect into me. Mr. Hemsley helped me immensely to become who I am today. 
	He was my 7th Grade Exploring Technology Teacher & my 8th Grade Advanced Technology Teacher. In his class we were introduced to SketchUp (the first AutoCAD Program I got to know),
	Scratch, and basic Wood-Cutting & Wood-Painting skills. Learning SketchUp and Scratch introduced me to the World of STEM. I had previously been messing around with a LEGO Mindstorms kit (projects can be seen in Portfolio), which first introduced me
	to STEM, but learning the Fundamentals of Coding and AutoCAD Design helped me figure out what exactly I wanted to become. Not only did he introduce these skills to me, but in 8th Grade, when I had to test some of my Science Olympiad Projects (projects can be seen in Portfolio), 
	he was there to help, and he consistently allowed me to use his facility & tools after school hours, even when he was busy with another club, or was getting ready for the next day. This allowed me to place 5th Place in State in Wheeled Vehicle (a Science Olympiad Project).
	I have so much to thank Mr. Hemsley for. </p>

	The next teacher that helped me become who I am, is Ms. Rosa. She was my World History Teacher in 9th Grade. Although her class was for History, she taught me much more than just this.
	She taught me responsibility, work ethic, and how to be mature (because, I really wasn't until then). My 9th grade Intro to Engineering & Design Teacher, Dr. Collins, also greatly impacted me. She completely supported me in each endeavor I wanted to accomplish.
	For example, when I wanted to start an Electronics Club at Ayala, I knew that she was the perfect advisor for this club, since she loves Electronics. Also, when I wanted to compete in a Coding Competition, Code Quest, she was also there to support the team (Anderson & Jumhelle) and myself.
	Also, I need to thank my Math II & Math III Teacher, Mrs. Rouchon, because, she made an entirely boring subject, Math, fun & easy to learn. Since I want to become an Engineer, math is critical for me, and having a teacher which makes the subject more fun, is amazing.
	<p>Another teacher which I have to thank, is Mr. Pittman, my AP Computer Science Principles teacher. Mr. Pittman, is literally, the BEST Teacher that I have ever had. Honestly & sincerely, Mr. Pittman is not only an amazing teacher, but is an amazing advisor for the STEM Robotics Club.
	Being a new officer of the club was tough, since I had to learn the different processes of club and the different responsibilities of being an officer. The combined welcomeness of Mr. Pittman and the other officers allowed me to fit perfectly in the club, as an officer. If there was one 
	word which I would use to describe Mr. Pittman, it would be his dedication. Not only is Mr. Pittman dedicated to being a great teacher, but he is also dedicated to putting in time for the club. Every day, after school, Mr. Pittman is there for the team for at least two hours. I don't think I
	know many other teachers that would put in that amount of time into making sure that our club can produce the best team that we can. <p>
	In conclusion, all of my teachers have been great, but some teachers have gone beyond being an amazing teacher, and are amazing, in general.</p>
